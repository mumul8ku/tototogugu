The firmness of this fruity flesh can be adjusted according to their will, and when taking a man inside, his body will easily sink, but once he's inside, they'll wrap him up and won't let him go. Even if a man tries to pull his hips away, the elastic, bouncy flesh of the fruit will push him back.

As this repeats, they will end up having continuous sex.\n\nThe exquisite cotton that can be collected from them remains permanently fluffy. It's possible to pack it without the fragrance and mamono mana leaking out or deteriorating.

Those who become succubi are banished from their village and seek human men due to the succubus' instinct.\n\nIn the early stages of transformation, elves retain their noble and proud elven mind, but their body changes into that of a succubus, always seeking human men and tempting their hearts. They resist the throbbing and try to avoid men, but eventually, they give into their instinct and have sex with a man. After taking in essence this way, an elf's mind melts with pleasure, and her body and heart change completely into that of a succubus.\n\nSuccubus-elves actively seduce and have sex with men as if the hatred of humanity they had harbored until then was just a lie. They receive the thick white semen of human men they used to despise as if to defile every part of themselves that used to be clean, showing ecstasy on their faces. Ironically, the longer they endure it, the more powerful and lewd a Succubus-Elf they end up changing into.\n\nDespite being monsters, elves still have traces of their noble elven mind even after becoming succubi. Their transformation is not instant but gradual, which suggests that they can still be saved from succubus corruption if intervened early enough.

She will paralyze him with her tongue saliva and drag him back to her cozy lair. Once at her lair, she puts her hands and nose-tendrils all over him to sense his shape and form. This inevitably leads her hands and nose to his penis, where foreplay begins. Her labia are lined with sensitive bioluminescent rays that slide and grip tightly against the man's penis during mating.\n\nAs the man grows accustomed to life mostly underground, he gains the ability to see in the dark, and marriage soon follows.\n\nReproductive method\nLive birth / mammalian\nFamily / Type\nTalpidae / Beastman\nHabitat\nNear water, marshes, rivers\nDisposition\nDexterous, resourceful, stealthy, curious, nosy\nDiet\nInsects","constant":false,"selective":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"secondary_keys":[],"keys":["Star-nosed Mole"],"id":245,"priority":100,"insertion_order":100,"enabled":true,"name":"","extensions":{},"case_sensitive":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"displayIndex":245,"addMemo":true,"probability":100,"useProbability":true},"246":{"uid":246,"key":["Bookworm"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"","content":"A Bookworm is a unique monster girl that combines the elements of a mystic worm and a pixie-sized librarian. The worm is green and segmented and peering out of a voluminous enchanted encyclopedia. The worm is about 40cm long and large enough to accommodate a man's erect penis. The worm has a strange vagina-shaped mouth and a lubricated, muscular interior, able to grip on the man's penis.\n\nThe worm serves as the bodily housing for the small pixie-sized librarian girl inside, who emerges from the worm's mouth. She wears librarian's glasses and has her hair tied back in a bun. She resides inside the worm like wearing a large puffy dress. She has a smirking know-it-all attitude and is always explaining or talking down to the man, treating him like a simpleton or dunce. The girl can flip through the pages of the encyclopedia at will without having to physically touch the pages.\n\nThe girl invites the man to slide his penis into the worm's mouth while she uses her pixie hands and tongue to stroke his penis head. As he slides his penis into the worm's mouth, he pushes her pixie-girl body back inside the worm, where her condescension can't be heard. While sliding his penis back and forth inside the worm's mouth, the girl teases and strokes his penis to coax out his essence. The feeling of both the worm's muscular grip and the girl's coaxing of the man's penis provides an incredible sex experience.\n\nIf a man is annoyed by the girl's attitude, he may slide his penis into the worm's mouth to effectively shut her up, while she gladly accepts his essence.\n\nReproductive method\nNone.
